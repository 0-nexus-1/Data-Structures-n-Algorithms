# Data Structures And Algorithms
**Data Structures and Algorithms** are two closely related concepts in computer science.
1. **Data Structures** are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples of common data structures include **arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs**.
2. **Algorithms**, on the other hand, are a set of instructions that solve a specific problem or perform a specific task. They can be implemented using various programming languages and can make use of different data structures to solve the problem at hand. Examples of common algorithms include sorting algorithms **(e.g. quicksort, mergesort), search algorithms (e.g. binary search, linear search)**, and graph algorithms **(e.g. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm)**.
3. **Together**, data structures and algorithms form the backbone of computer science, allowing us to create efficient and effective solutions for a wide range of problems. Understanding and being able to apply both concepts is crucial for any computer science professional.
