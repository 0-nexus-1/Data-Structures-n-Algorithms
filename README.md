# Stack_Implementation
Program implementation unisg stack Data Structure.
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. The two main operations on a stack are push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing the top element). Stacks can also have an operation to check the top element without removing it, called peek. It can be implemented using an array or a linked list. Stacks are used in many algorithms and data structures such as depth-first search, undo/redo functionality in text editors, and call stack in programming languages.
